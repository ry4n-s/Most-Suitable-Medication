# Most Suitable Medication 🌳💊🔍

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository features a machine learning project focused on predicting the most suitable medication for patients based on their health metrics. The project uses a hypothetical dataset, resembling a real-world medical research scenario, where patients respond to one of five medications based on factors like age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The goal is to build a Decision Tree Classifier model to determine the appropriate drug for future patients with similar health conditions.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Health-Related Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset comprising patient health metrics and their responses to different medications.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps like label encoding for converting categorical variables into a machine-readable form.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Implementation of a decision tree model to predict the medication based on patient data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualization of the decision tree for a better understanding of how the model makes predictions.

## 🛠️ Built With
- Python: For data manipulation and model building.
- Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
- Scikit-Learn: For implementing the Decision Tree Classifier and data preprocessing tools.
- Matplotlib: For visualization of the decision tree.

## 🎯 Application Scenarios
- **Healthcare and Medical Research**: Useful for medical professionals and researchers in predicting patient responses to medications.
- **Pharmaceutical Research**: Can aid in understanding patient demographics and their responses to various drugs.

## 🔍 Inside the Code
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distributions and correlations of different features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transformation of categorical features into numerical ones for model compatibility.
- **Decision Tree Training**: Details the process of training the decision tree classifier and fine-tuning parameters.
- **Model Accuracy**: Evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy on the test dataset.
